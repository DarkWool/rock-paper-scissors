# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game for The Odin Project.

This project is part of the main curriculum for TOP, it covered basic JavaScript to play the game with the browser's console which later evolved to a basic HTML UI.

With this project we were also able to learn about Git branches and how to merge them.
